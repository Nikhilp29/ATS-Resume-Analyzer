### ⚠️ Note on Deployment

This project is currently deployed on **Render.com**, a free hosting platform that may experience occasional cold starts or slower response times due to inactivity or high server load. 

**If you encounter errors like "Internal Server Error" or slow predictions:**

- Please **wait 15–30 seconds** and try again.
- Refresh the page and re-upload your resume.
- Ensure the resume is in **PDF format with readable text** (not scanned image PDFs).

For better performance in the future, we may explore hosting on **Streamlit Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces**.
If the app doesn’t respond immediately, please wait a few moments and try again — the server may be waking up from idle or handling another request. For the best experience, consider deploying the app on Hugging Face Spaces or a more scalable platform.
